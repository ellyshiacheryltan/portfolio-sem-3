However, we got two different feedbacks from two different teachers that results in the final iteration of the logo. The feedbacks are: the S and O having the same type of typography might confuse people, and the O does not really look like an O because of the big gap between the end of the curve and the thin line in the middle. Taking the feedbacks into account, I modified the logo to look like the ones below, and these are the final logos.",

I asked for feedback to a teacher regarding the three designs, the feedback is that QR usage is not recommended for trustworthiness reasons, and for the second and third designs there are distortions in the logo, so it is not recommended. Based on this feedback, me and my teammates agreed to use the first design as our final business card design.",
    textLearned: "From this work I learned that the usage of QR is nowadays not encouraged anymore due to online safety reasons, and I also learned to avoid logo distortions in design next time. I also learned how the constant research for inspirations on the internet is important and crucial to creating a modern and up-to-date design."

All of this I learned from the Youtube tutorials.",

Two of my teammates’ stylescapes got voted the most, then we asked for feedback to a teacher. The feedback we got is to look up how big agencies do their branding and follow the trend, however the teacher also said that if we want to go for something different, it is definitely allowed.  Me and my team decided to adopt the minimalism trend but combine it still with our own style from the top 2 chosen stylescapes. Every member translated this to our own stylescapes.
